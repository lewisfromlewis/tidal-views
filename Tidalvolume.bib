  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether PEEP titration guided by esophageal pressure (PES), an estimate of pleural pressure, was more effective than empirical high PEEP\textendash{}fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) in moderate to severe ARDS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted at 14 hospitals in North America. Two hundred mechanically ventilated patients aged 16 years and older with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2:FIO2 Õ…200 mm Hg) were enrolled between October 31, 2012, and September 14, 2017; long-term follow-up was completed July 30, 2018. Visual Abstract Editorial Supplemental content INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to PES-guided PEEP (n = 102) or empirical high PEEP-FIO2 (n = 98). All participants received low tidal volumes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a ranked composite score incorporating death and days free from mechanical ventilation among survivors through day 28. Prespecified secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality, days free from mechanical ventilation among survivors, and need for rescue therapy.
RESULTS Two hundred patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 56 [16] years; 46\% female) and completed 28-day follow-up. The primary composite end point was not significantly different between treatment groups (probability of more favorable outcome with PES-guided PEEP: 49.6\% [95\% CI, 41.7\% to 57.5\%]; P = .92). At 28 days, 33 of 102 patients (32.4\%) assigned to PES-guided PEEP and 30 of 98 patients (30.6\%) assigned to empirical PEEP-FIO2 died (risk difference, 1.7\% [95\% CI, -11.1\% to 14.6\%]; P = .88). Days free from mechanical ventilation among survivors was not significantly different (median [interquartile range]: 22 [15-24] vs 21 [16.5-24] days; median difference, 0 [95\% CI, -1 to 2] days; P = .85). Patients assigned to PES-guided PEEP were significantly less likely to receive rescue therapy (4/102 [3.9\%] vs 12/98 [12.2\%]; risk difference, -8.3\% [95\% CI, -15.8\% to -0.8\%]; P = .04). None of the 7 other prespecified secondary clinical end points were significantly different. Adverse events included gross barotrauma, which occurred in 6 patients with PES-guided PEEP and 5 patients with empirical PEEP-FIO2.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with moderate to severe ARDS, PES-guided PEEP, compared with empirical high PEEP-FIO2, resulted in no significant difference in death and days free from mechanical ventilation. These findings do not support PES-guided PEEP titration in ARDS.},

  abstract = {Background
Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are life threatening clinical conditions seen in critically ill patients with diverse underlying illnesses. Lung injury may be perpetuated by ventilation strategies that do not limit lung volumes and airway pressures. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pressure and volume-limited (PVL) ventilation strategies with more traditional mechanical ventilation in adults with ALI and ARDS.

Methods and Findings
We searched Medline, EMBASE, HEALTHSTAR and CENTRAL, related articles on PubMed\texttrademark, conference proceedings and bibliographies of identified articles for randomized trials comparing PVL ventilation with traditional approaches to ventilation in critically ill adults with ALI and ARDS. Two reviewers independently selected trials, assessed trial quality, and abstracted data. We identified ten trials (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1,749) meeting study inclusion criteria. Tidal volumes achieved in control groups were at the lower end of the traditional range of 10\textendash{}15 mL/kg. We found a clinically important but borderline statistically significant reduction in hospital mortality with PVL [relative risk (RR) 0.84; 95\% CI 0.70, 1.00; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.05]. This reduction in risk was attenuated (RR 0.90; 95\% CI 0.74, 1.09, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.27) in a sensitivity analysis which excluded 2 trials that combined PVL with open-lung strategies and stopped early for benefit. We found no effect of PVL on barotrauma; however, use of paralytic agents increased significantly with PVL (RR 1.37; 95\% CI, 1.04, 1.82; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.03).

Conclusions
This systematic review suggests that PVL strategies for mechanical ventilation in ALI and ARDS reduce mortality and are associated with increased use of paralytic agents.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of personalised mechanical ventilation on clinical outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains uncertain and needs to be evaluated. We aimed to test whether a mechanical ventilation strategy that was personalised to individual patients' lung morphology would improve the survival of patients with ARDS when compared with standard of care.
METHODS: We designed a multicentre, single-blind, stratified, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial enrolling patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS in 20 university or non-university intensive care units in France. Patients older than 18 years with early ARDS for less than 12 h were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the control group or the personalised group using a minimisation algorithm and stratified according to the study site, lung morphology, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Only the patients were masked to allocation. In the control group, patients received a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg per predicted bodyweight and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was selected according to a low PEEP and fraction of inspired oxygen table, and early prone position was encouraged. In the personalised group, the treatment approach was based on lung morphology; patients with focal ARDS received a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, low PEEP, and prone position. Patients with non-focal ARDS received a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg, along with recruitment manoeuvres and high PEEP. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality as established by intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered online with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02149589.
FINDINGS: From June 12, 2014, to Feb 2, 2017, 420 patients were randomly assigned to treatment. 11 patients were excluded in the personalised group and nine patients were excluded in the control group; 196 patients in the personalised group and 204 in the control group were included in the analysis. In a multivariate analysis, there was no difference in 90-day mortality between the group treated with personalised ventilation and the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 1{$\cdot$}01; 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}61-1{$\cdot$}66; p=0{$\cdot$}98). However, misclassification of patients as having focal or non-focal ARDS by the investigators was observed in 85 (21\%) of 400 patients. We found a significant interaction between misclassification and randomised group allocation with respect to the primary outcome (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}001). In the subgroup analysis, the 90-day mortality of the misclassified patients was higher in the personalised group (26 [65\%] of 40 patients) than in the control group (18 [32\%] of 57 patients; HR 2{$\cdot$}8; 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}5-5{$\cdot$}1; p=0{$\cdot$}012.
INTERPRETATION: Personalisation of mechanical ventilation did not decrease mortality in patients with ARDS, possibly because of the misclassification of 21\% of patients. A ventilator strategy misaligned with lung morphology substantially increases mortality. Whether improvement in ARDS phenotyping can decrease mortality should be assessed in a future clinical trial.

  abstract = {Background In patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neuromuscular blocking agents may improve oxygenation and decrease ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause muscle weakness. We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS.
Methods In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model.
Results The hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P\,=\,0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6\% (95\% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7\% (95\% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P\,=\,0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7\% (95\% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3\% (95\% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P\,=\,0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups.
Conclusions In patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Dead-space fraction (Vd/Vt) has been shown to be a powerful predictor of mortality in acute lung injury (ALI) patients. The measurement of Vd/Vt is based on the analysis of expired CO2 which is not a part of standard practice thus limiting widespread clinical application of this method. The objective of this study was to determine prognostic value of Vd/Vt estimated from routinely collected pulmonary variables.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of the original data from two prospective studies of ALI patients. Estimated Vd/Vt was calculated using the rearranged alveolar gas equation: Vd/Vt=1-[(0.86\texttimes{}VCO2est)/(VE\texttimes{}PaCO2)] where VCO2est is the estimated CO2 production calculated from the Harris Benedict equation, minute ventilation (VE) is obtained from the ventilator rate and expired tidal volume and PaCO2 from arterial gas analysis. Logistic regression models were created to determine the prognostic value of estimated Vd/Vt.
RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients in Mayo Clinic validation cohort and 1896 patients in ARDS-net cohort demonstrated an increase in percent mortality for every 10\% increase in Vd/Vt in a dose response fashion. After adjustment for non-pulmonary and pulmonary prognostic variables, both day 1 (adjusted odds ratio-OR = 1.07, 95\%CI 1.03 to 1.13) and day 3 (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.18) estimated dead-space fraction predicted hospital mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated estimated Vd/Vt predicts mortality in ALI patients in a dose response manner. A modified alveolar gas equation may be of clinical value for a rapid bedside estimation of Vd/Vt, utilizing routinely collected clinical data.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial of 2013 adults with body mass indices of 35 or greater and substantial risk for postoperative pulmonary complications who were undergoing noncardiac, nonneurological surgery under general anesthesia. The trial was conducted at 77 sites in 23 countries from July 2014-February 2018; final follow-up: May 2018. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to the high level of PEEP group (n = 989), consisting of a PEEP level of 12 cm H2O with alveolar recruitment maneuvers (a stepwise increase of tidal volume and eventually PEEP) or to the low level of PEEP group (n = 987), consisting of a PEEP level of 4 cm H2O. All patients received volume-controlled ventilation with a tidal volume of 7 mL/kg of predicted body weight. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a composite of pulmonary complications within the first 5 postoperative days, including respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchospasm, new pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary infection, aspiration pneumonitis, pleural effusion, atelectasis, cardiopulmonary edema, and pneumothorax. Among the 9 prespecified secondary outcomes, 3 were intraoperative complications, including hypoxemia (oxygen desaturation with SpO2 Õ…92\% for {$>$}1 minute).
RESULTS Among 2013 adults who were randomized, 1976 (98.2\%) completed the trial (mean age, 48.8 years; 1381 [69.9\%] women; 1778 [90.1\%] underwent abdominal operations). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome occurred in 211 of 989 patients (21.3\%) in the high level of PEEP group compared with 233 of 987 patients (23.6\%) in the low level of PEEP group (difference, -2.3\% [95\% CI, -5.9\% to 1.4\%]; risk ratio, 0.93 [95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.04]; P = .23).

RESULTS In total, 961 patients (65\% male), with a median age of 68 years (interquartile range [IQR], 59-76), were enrolled. At day 28, 475 patients in the low tidal volume group had a median of 21 ventilator-free days (IQR, 0-26), and 480 patients in the intermediate tidal volume group had a median of 21 ventilator-free days (IQR, 0-26) (mean difference, \textendash{}0.27 [95\% CI, \textendash{}1.74 to 1.19]; P = .71). There was no significant difference in ICU (median, 6 vs 6 days; 0.39 [\textendash{}1.09 to 1.89]; P = .58) and hospital (median, 14 vs 15 days; \textendash{}0.60 [\textendash{}3.52 to 2.31]; P = .68) length of stay or 28-day (34.9\% vs 32.1\%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.12 [0.90 to 1.40]; P = .30) and 90-day (39.1\% vs 37.8\%; HR, 1.07 [0.87 to 1.31]; P = .54) mortality. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients developing the following adverse events: ARDS (3.8\% vs 5.0\%; risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [0.59 to 1.24]; P = .38), pneumonia (4.2\% vs 3.7\%; RR, 1.07 [0.78 to 1.47]; P = .67), severe atelectasis (11.4\% vs 11.2\%; RR, 1.00 [0.81 to 1.23]; P = .94), and pneumothorax (1.8\% vs 1.3\%; RR, 1.16 [0.73 to 1.84]; P = .55).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients in the ICU without ARDS who were expected not to be extubated within 24 hours of randomization, a low tidal volume strategy did not result in a greater number of ventilator-free days than an intermediate tidal volume strategy.},
